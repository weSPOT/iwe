Elgg Language Packs
===================

This Git repository contains files (only one at the moment) that are shared between the
[Elgg Language Packs](https://github.com/fmestrone/languagepacks "Language Packs plugin for Elgg")
plugin and the
[ReGlot Elgg Translate](https://github.com/fmestrone/elggtranslate "Elgg Translate plugin for ReGlot")
plugin.

Keeping these files into this project guarantees maximum compatibility, better
reusability, and easier maintenance of the two plugins. As the two work tightly together,
it is important that a certain code base is shared between them.

The code in this project relates to the format and structure of a language pack, the
format and structure of the meta data files in a language pack, and the import/export of
languages packs. Everything UI-related is developed in the corresponding plugins.
